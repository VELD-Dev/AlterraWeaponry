# Install
Install process in few steps.

### Dependecies
* **[QModManager 4](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/1 "NexusMods - QModManager 4") 4.4.3 or higher** (See on the page how to install it)
* **[SMLHelper Zero](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/34 "NexusMods - SMLHelper Zero") 2.13.4 or higher** (See on the page how to install it)

### Step 1
Download the mod in the [files category on the NexusMods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/286?tab=files "NexusMods - Alterra Weaponry > Files") - If there's none, just wait for a release (however, if you're a developer you can still build it yourself as a "latest version beta")  
If, and only if, you do not trust **NexusMods**, download it from the [releases page of the repo](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/AlterraWeaponry/releases "Releases"), you should find early and beta versions (I recommend taking releases instead of betas) but be careful, they might crash your game, maybe ?

### Step 2
Once you have downloaded it, **uncompress** the `.zip` file (or **move** the uncompressed folder) into  
`SubnauticaZero > QMods >`, it should look like this :  
`SubnauticaZero > QMods > VELDsAlterraWeaponry > mod.json`

### Step 3
?

### Step 4
Enjoy your play with ported and brand new weapons & upgrades ! Do not be scared neither by Leviathans nor by this brute shark next to your base.
